# Dbcleaner
Create an original file and keys file , remove emojis and escape characters from original file before running this and then u can add them later using another script
Cleaning txt files based on keywords , when the keyword is found it should be either a single word itseld or surrounded by punctuation or emojis or a combination 
of spaces and punctution and emojis ,

let  s say the keyword is "dating" . only lines that include dating like this " this is dating." or "this is 'dating " or followed by emojis will be deleted so lines
that includes words like "intimidating" won't be deleted althouugh it includes the word "dating"
